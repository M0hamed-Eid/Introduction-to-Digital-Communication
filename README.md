# Introduction-to-Digital-Communication
This repository contains MATLAB files for an "Introduction to Digital Communication" course. The course covers the basics of digital communication systems, including modulation, demodulation, channel coding, and error correction.

The MATLAB files in this repository are intended to be used as educational resources for students and instructors. They provide examples of digital communication systems and algorithms that can be used to simulate and analyze the performance of these systems.

Getting Started
To use the MATLAB files in this repository, you will need to have MATLAB installed on your computer. You can download a free trial version of MATLAB from the MathWorks website if you don't have access to a licensed copy.

Once you have MATLAB installed, you can download the MATLAB files from this repository and open them in the MATLAB editor. The files are organized into folders that correspond to the topics covered in the course.

Usage
Each MATLAB file in this repository corresponds to a specific example or exercise in the course. The files are designed to be run in MATLAB, either by pressing the "Run" button in the MATLAB editor or by typing the filename in the MATLAB command window.

The MATLAB files are well-documented and include comments that explain what each line of code does. You can modify the code to experiment with different digital communication systems and algorithms, or use the code as a starting point for your own projects.

Contributing
If you find a bug or issue with any of the MATLAB files in this repository, please open an issue on GitHub. If you would like to contribute your own MATLAB files or improvements to the existing files, you can create a pull request and we will review your changes.

License
The MATLAB files in this repository are licensed under the FoE Alexandria University. You are free to use, modify, and distribute the code as long as you include the original license text and copyright notice in your own work.
